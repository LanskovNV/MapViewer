![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LanskovNV/MapViewer/master/app/images/mapbanner.png)
## Purpose
MapViewer is the JavaScript project designed using ReactJS library to work with maps uploaded in .json format.
The application runs on most desktop browsers (ex. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, e.t.c.).

### Quick start guide

1. For the very beginning you need to choose one of two languages the application supports: Russian or English. You can do it by using the local toggle situated down below.

*Now when you can read and understand the necessary data, let's continue our introduction.*

2. Then you need to choose the map you want to parse. You might choose the prepared map from the list *(it is located on the home page)* or ***upload your own map*** from the local drive in ***.json*** format.

*Now let's move to the map page and research what you can do with the map.*

3. Using buttons ***'left'*** , ***'right'*** , ***'up'*** and ***'down'*** you can navigate the map.
4. By clicking on ***'+'*** and ***'-'*** buttons down below or by rotating the mouse wheel, you can ***zoom in / zoom out*** your map.
5. You can choose all the necessary types of data you want to see now using ***checkboxes***.

*And now you're ready to start!*

## Limitations
1. You can upload the map ***only*** in ***.json*** format.
2. In the *show only* mode you can choose only the types of data which are provided (look on the checkhboxes). For example you're not able to see only the forestlands.
